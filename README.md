# Student-Information-System-using-java

**Summary:**
This Java mini project is a console-based application that manages student details using core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It involves multiple classes like Person, Student, GraduateStudent, and Course, showcasing features such as multilevel inheritance, method and constructor overloading, interfaces, and static members.

The **Student** class extends **Person** and implements the **Grade** interface to calculate average grades.
The **GraduateStudent** class extends **Student** and adds a thesis topic, demonstrating multilevel inheritance.
The **Course** class represents course details, and students can enroll in multiple courses.
A **static** variable keeps track of the total number of students created.
The project runs via a **Main** class, where different student and course objects are created and tested.

**Technologies Used:** Core Java, OOP Principles
**Key Concepts:** Inheritance, Interfaces, Static Methods, Constructor Overloading



**🖥️ Step-by-Step to Compile and Run**

✅ Step 1: Place all files in the same folder
For example, create a folder called StudentInfoSystem and move all .java files into it.

✅ Step 2: Open terminal or command prompt in that folder
Windows: Shift + Right Click → “Open PowerShell window here”
Mac/Linux: Right click → “Open in Terminal”

✅ Step 3: Compile all Java files
In terminal, run:  javac *.java 
This command compiles all .java files in the folder.

✅ Step 4: Run the program
After successful compilation, run the main class: java Main

✅ Optional: Use IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
Create a new Java Project
Add all .java files under the src directory
Right-click Main.java → Run
