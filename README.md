## 🚀 Features

- Add student and graduate student details
- Enroll students in courses
- Assign and calculate average grades
- Display student and course information
- Track total number of students

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- ✅ Class & Object Design
- ✅ **Constructor and Method Overloading**
- ✅ **Multilevel Inheritance** (`Person` → `Student` → `GraduateStudent`)
- ✅ **Interfaces** for grade calculation
- ✅ **Static variables/methods** to track student count

**🖥️ Step-by-Step to Compile and Run**

✅ Step 1: Place all files in the same folder
For example, create a folder called StudentInfoSystem and move all .java files into it.

✅ Step 2: Open terminal or command prompt in that folder
Windows: Shift + Right Click → “Open PowerShell window here”
Mac/Linux: Right click → “Open in Terminal”

✅ Step 3: Compile all Java files
In terminal, run:  javac *.java 
This command compiles all .java files in the folder.

✅ Step 4: Run the program
After successful compilation, run the main class: java Main

✅ Optional: Use IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
Create a new Java Project
Add all .java files under the src directory
Right-click Main.java → Run
